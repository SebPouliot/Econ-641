  Abstract                 = {This article investigates the economic effects of conflict, using the terrorist conflict in the Basque Country as a case study. We find that, after the outbreak of terrorism in the late 1960&#039;s, per capita GDP in the Basque Country declined about 10 percentage points relative to a synthetic control region without terrorism. In addition, we use the 1998-1999 truce as a natural experiment. We find that stocks of firms with a significant part of their business in the Basque Country showed a positive relative performance when truce became credible, and a negative relative performance at the end of the cease-fire.},

Results in this article show that the WASDE announcement effect persists across contract positions, is not limited to months that include NASS crop survey data, is amplified during low carryover periods for soybeans and wheat,and is rapidly incorporated into futures prices.},

  Abstract                 = { The literature on measuring the size and distribution of returns to research has paid increasing attention of late to questions that require a multimarket framework. These questions include the distribution of benefits among stages of a multistage process or among factors of production (i.e. the vertical incidence) and the distribution across different markets either for the same product in different places or for different products (the horizontal incidence). The latter may be regarded as including quality change which has attracted recent attention. In much of the literature, a linear elasticity modeling approach has been used to obtain measures of the consequences of research-induced supply shifts for prices and quantities which, in turn, are used to evaluate the size and distribution of welfare effects. This review summarizes the state of the art of that work. It is a selective treatment, beginning with a simple basic model of research benefits and proceeding to consider increasingly complicated problems of vertically and horizontally related markets. The recurring theme is the theoretical and empirical questions surrounding (a) how to represent technical changes, and model their effects on equilibrium displacements, in a theoretically consistent manner, and (b) how to translate those equilibrium displacement effects into welfare measures.},

  Abstract                 = { Output quotas are known to be more efficient than input quotas in transferring surplus from consumers to producers. Input quotas, by distorting the shadow prices of inputs, lead to inefficient production and generate larger deadweight losses, for a given amount of surplus transferred. Yet, input quotas have been a ubiquitous tool in agricultural policy. Practicality considerations, as well as the difficulty to control outputs that heavily depend on stochastic weather conditions, are arguments that help understand why policy makers may favor input quotas over output quotas. In this paper, we offer an additional explanation that rests on efficiency considerations. Assuming that the regulator only has limited knowledge about the market fundamentals (supply and demand elasticities, among others), seeks to transfer at least a given amount of surplus to producers and is influenced by the industry in his choice of the quota level, we show that an input quota becomes the optimal policy.},

  Abstract                 = {Agriculture is diverse and full of contradictions. The sector accounts for a comparatively small share of the global economy, but remains central to the lives of a great many people. In 2012, of the world's 7.1 billion people, an estimated 1.3 billion (19 percent) were directly engaged in farming, but agriculture (including the relatively small hunting/fishing and forestry sectors) represented just 2.8 percent of overall income (World Bank 2012). However, in today's middle- and low-income countries, where most of the world's farmers are to be found, agriculture accounts for a much greater share of national income and employment&#8212;for instance, in India, agriculture represents 18 percent of national income and 54 percent of employment.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper first considers the impact on world food prices of the changes in restrictions on trade in staple foods during the 2008 world food price crisis. Those changes--reductions in import protection or increases in export restraints--were meant to partially insulate domestic markets from the spike in international prices. The authors find that this insulation added substantially to the spike in international prices for rice, wheat, maize, and oilseeds. As a result, although domestic prices rose less than they would have without insulation in some developing countries, in many other countries they rose more than they would have in the absence of such insulation. The paper's second purpose it to estimate the combined impact of such insulating behavior on poverty in various developing countries and globally. The analysis finds that the actual poverty-reducing impact of insulation is much less than its apparent impact, and that its net effect was to increase global poverty in 2008 by 8 million people, although this increase was not significantly different from zero. The paper examines the relative efficiency and equity of trade restrictions and domestic policies, such as conditional cash transfers, than are designed to provide social protection for the poor when international food prices spike. It also examines the potential consequences of multilateral agreements to limit changes in restrictions on trade during such times.},

  Abstract                 = { Since Edward Leamer's memorable 1983 paper, "Let's Take the Con out of Econometrics," empirical microeconomics has experienced a credibility revolution. While Leamer's suggested remedy, sensitivity analysis, has played a role in this, we argue that the primary engine driving improvement has been a focus on the quality of empirical research designs. The advantages of a good research design are perhaps most easily apparent in research using random assignment. We begin with an overview of Leamer's 1983 critique and his proposed remedies. We then turn to the key factors we see contributing to improved empirical work, including the availability of more and better data, along with advances in theoretical econometric understanding, but especially the fact that research design has moved front and center in much of empirical micro. We offer a brief digression into macroeconomics and industrial organization, where progress -- by our lights -- is less dramatic, although there is work in both fields that we find encouraging. Finally, we discuss the view that the design pendulum has swung too far. Critics of design-driven studies argue that in pursuit of clean and credible research designs, researchers seek good answers instead of good questions. We briefly respond to this concern, which worries us little.},

Using output and input prices, county production quotas, and quota rental rate data, we estimate a marginal cost function for North Carolina fluecured tobacco to demonstrate how wage increases affect owners' and renters' welfare.},

Actuarial fairness cannot be achieved if constant multiplicative factors are used to determine how premiums change as coverage levels increase. A comparison of premium rates generated by the factors used by the two most popular crop insurance products with those generated by a standard yield distribution shows that the popular insurance products overcharge for low-deductible policies in most counties. This overpricing may explain why large premium subsidies were required to induce farmers to move from low-deductible to high-deductible policies beginning in 2001.},

We develop generalized bivariate error correction models that allow for cointegration between sugar, ethanol, and oil prices, where dynamic adjustments are potentially nonlinear functions of the disequilibrium errors. A range of models are estimated using Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithms and compared using Bayesian model selection methods. The results suggest that the long-run drivers of Brazilian sugar prices are oil prices and that there are nonlinearities in the adjustment processes of sugar and ethanol prices to oil price but linear adjustment between ethanol and sugar prices.},

A nonparametric analysis of consumer expenditure patterns suggests that Engel curves require quadratic terms in the logarithm of expenditure. While popular models of demand such as the Translog or the Almost Ideal Demand Systems do allow flexible price responses within a theoretically coherent structure, they have expenditure share Engel curves that are linear in the logarithm of total expenditure. We derive the complete class of integrable quadratic logarithmic expenditure share systems. A specification from this class is estimated on a large pooled data set of U.K. households. Models that fail to account for Engel curvature are found to generate important distortions in the patterns of welfare losses associated with a tax increase.},

We first compare investment behavior in the no tax baseline to a tax control setting, in which the income from investments is taxed. We find that investors significantly reduce their risk-taking as predicted by theory. Next we compare the baseline investment choices to choices under three different types of income taxation. We observe that risk-taking is significantly increased with partial and with capped loss deduction, but is unaffected by a tax system that allows no loss deduction. Since in all these treatments the after tax outcomes of the prospects were identical, we conjecture that investors have a positively biased perception of partial and capped loss deduction that promotes their willingness to take risks.},

One challenge was to reconcile two visions for the place of the economist in policy analysis, one limited to providing positive analysis for decision-makers, the other allowing normative judgments. This tension came to a crisis when, in the 1960s, the Water Resources Council introduced multi-objective benefit-cost analysis. The surrounding debate highlights the way philosophical differences can drive the technical details of policy analysis, the way political debates can overshadow academic ones, and the way even social scientists in a narrow subfield can profoundly misunderstand one another.},

By assimilating the theory of advertising into the theory of complements, we avoid the special approaches to advertising found in many studies that place obstacles in the way of understanding the effects of advertising. We also use this approach to evaluate advertising from a welfare perspective. Whether there is excessive or too little advertising depends on several variables: the effects on consumer utility, the degree of competition in the market for advertised goods, the induced changes in prices and outputs of advertised goods, and whether advertising is sold to consumers.},

Moreover, legislator preferences and electoral incentives appear to be substitutes for one another. Why does Congress support agricultural protection?

An empirical analysis of commuters' mode choice shows that the stated intention data have predictive validity if their biases and errors are properly corrected.},

A nonhomothetic, nonneutral generalized Box-Cox cost function is employed which takes on the generalized Leontief, generalized square-root quadratic, and translog cost functions as special or limiting cases. Total factor productivity is estimated parametrically rather than being computed as the residual of growth in outputs minus growth in inputs. We find substantial economies of scale and relatively little technological change.},

The authors' framework enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. Applying these techniques, the authors obtain parameters for essentially all autos sold over a twenty-year period. Copyright 1995 by The Econometric Society.},

In daily newspapers, where quality is produced with fixed costs, the average quality of products increases with market size, but the market does not offer much additional variety as it grows large. These results are consistent with IO theories of endogenous product quality and with theories that emphasize the consumption advantages of cities. Copyright 2010 The Authors.

To do this we utilize a time series of repeated cross sections covering some 4,000 households in each of 15 years. Employing a number of different aggregation procedures, we conclude that aggregate data alone are unlikely to produce reliable estimates of structural price and income coefficients. However, once certain "aggregation factors" as well as trend and seasonal components are included, an aggregate model is not necessarily outperformed across all demand equations in terms of forecasting ability.},

CIMMYT's success in developing countries has also reduced the world price for wheat. While the lower prices affect returns in Australia, the increased yields in Australia from the CIMMYT spillovers from both the semi-dwarfs and the post-semidwarf phases have provided benefits to Australia averaging A$30 million per year.

We also show that selection accounts for very little of this evolution. Instead, we propose a simple theory based on financing constraints. A calibrated version of our model does a good job at explaining the evolution of the firm size distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {Using data from the Current Population Survey, this paper describes the effect of the Mariel Boatlift of 1980 on the Miami labor market. The Mariel immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7%, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled. Nevertheless, the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier. The author suggests that the ability of Miami's labor market to rapidly absorb the Mariel immigrants was largely owing to its adjustment to other large waves of immigrants in the two decades before the Mariel Boatlift.},

  Abstract                 = {The almost ideal demand system is combined with the Fourier expenditure system. Subject to the assumption that preferences are of the price-independent, generalized-logarithmic class, the resulting demand system has the desirable features of each of its components. Aggregate demand equations are consistent with preferences of a representative consumer, and consistent estimates of elasticities are obtained for all observed prices. Application of the new demand system to U.S. consumption of meats and fish reveals that it fits the data well and that the restriction to the usual specification is rejected.},

  Abstract                 = {Optimal trade policy in an uncertain world is examined. Decision-maker attitudes toward uncertainty are represented in terms of the Gilboa-Schmeidler (1989) maximin expected-utility (MMEU) model. The central result is that in a two-country, general-equilibrium setting with both trading partners possessing an MMEU preference structure, Pareto optimality can require one trading partner to absorb all uncertainty in the economy if its set of priors is a subset of its trading partners. An immediate corollary is that autarky is Pareto optimal if the trading partner with the more inclusive set of priors either chooses or is endowed with a nonstochastic technology.},

Using concentration and cost data and product quality indicators for 2,244 products in over eighty industries in 1997 and 2002 in the US, a two-stage, ordered probit, random effects estimation explores the impact of concentration and cost on quality. The results demonstrate that overall market concentration and high fixed costs are both positively correlated with product quality across most industries. Generally, when either industry concentration or industry fixed costs increase, the likelihood of the product being higher quality increases and the likelihood of observing a lower quality decreases. Further, the authors confirm that prices are a good signal of product quality. A theoretical model is also derived.},

A second best policy of a fuel tax and ethanol subsidy is found to approximate fairly closely the welfare gains associated with the first best policy of an optimal carbon tax and tariffs on traded goods. The largest economic gains to the U.S. economy from these energy policies arise from their impact on U.S. terms of trade, particularly in the oil market. Conditional on the current fuel tax, an optimal ethanol mandate is superior to an optimal ethanol subsidy.},

The main result finds evidence of symmetric price transmission in retail gasoline market due to price shocks arising from the distributors. It is important to highlight that the disaggregation of the data allowed the study to show that the asymmetry is not a national problem, but specific to each city and different for each of the regions in Brazil. },

The firm first engages in R&D to affect the safety of its product. Since the outcome of R&D trials is unobservable to consumers, the firm then chooses its price, understanding that consumers may draw inferences from the price about the product's safety. Consumers acquire and use the product; injuries lead to losses which are allocated by the liability system. We vary the liability system's allocation of losses and trace out the implications for R&D investment and the price-safety relationship.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides a survey on studies that analyze the macroeconomic effects of intellectual property rights (IPR). The first part of this paper introduces different patent policy instruments and reviews their effects on R\&D and economic growth. This part also discusses the distortionary effects and distributional consequences of IPR protection as well as empirical evidence on the effects of patent rights. Then, the second part considers the international aspects of IPR protection. In summary, this paper draws the following conclusions from the literature. Firstly, different patent policy instruments have different effects on R\&D and growth. Secondly, there is empirical evidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection and innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries than for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR protection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation against the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality. Finally, in an open economy, achieving the globally optimal level of protection requires an international coordination (rather than the harmonization) of IPR protection.},

  Abstract                 = { A general theory of cross-subsidization due to inframarginal support is developed. Two sources of output distortion are identified: "exit deterrence" and "extramarginal output." Some firms would not be in business without the subsidy. Cost savings due to declining average costs are always greater than the losses incurred where price equals marginal cost. Moreover, it is theoretically possible for inframarginal subsidies to expand output more than equivalent fully coupled subsidies. Empirical analysis of U.S. dairy subsidies isolates these components of cross-subsidization and finds distortions from inframarginal support to be substantial, with implications for trade negotiations, dispute settlement, and policy formulation.

  Abstract                 = { A framework is developed to analyze the effects of a biofuel consumer tax exemption and the interaction effects with a price contingent farm subsidy. Ethanol prices rise above the gasoline price by the amount of the tax credit. Corn farmers gain directly while gasoline consumers only gain from any reduction in world oil prices due to the extra ethanol production. Domestic oil producers lose. Historically, the intercept of the ethanol supply curve is above the gasoline price. Hence, part of the tax credit is redundant and represents "rectangular" deadweight costs that dwarf triangular deadweight cost measures of traditional farm subsidies.

  Abstract                 = {The efficacy of alternative biofuel policies in achieving energy, environmental and agricultural policy goals is assessed using economic cost-benefit analysis. Government mandates are superior to consumption subsidies, especially with suboptimal fuel taxes and the higher costs involved with raising tax revenues. But subsidies with mandates cause adverse interaction effects; oil consumption is subsidized instead. This unique result also applies to renewable electricity that faces similar policy combinations. Ethanol policy can have a significant impact on corn prices; if not, inefficiency costs rise sharply. Ethanol policy can increase the inefficiency of farm subsidies and vice-versa. Policies that discriminate against trade, such as production subsidies and tariffs, can more than offset any benefits of a mandate. Sustainability standards are ineffective and illegal according to the WTO, and so should be re-designed.},

Subjects in the treatment group were given food safety information about poultry from a popular consumer magazine. Willingness to pay (WTP) estimates were then elicited for two types of chicken breasts: (1) a leading-brand that was identified in the information treatment as having a high incidence of Campylobacter and Salmonella bacteria; and (2) a lesser known brand, which was reported as being relatively free of harmful bacteria. Results indicated that both negative and positive food safety information significantly impacted consumers' WTP for safer chicken compared to the reportedly less-safe leading-brand chicken. These changes in behavior persisted throughout the seven-week study period.},

  Abstract                 = {Sugarcane in Brazil is processed into sugar and/or ethanol, often in flex plants that can switch between the two products. We develop an economic model of flex plants, export demands, and two domestic fuel demand curves for a blend of ethanol with gasoline consumed by conventional cars, and ethanol consumed only by flex cars. We analyze the market impacts of the following policies: the blend mandate; fixing gasoline prices below world prices; the high gasoline tax; and a higher tax exemption for ethanol blended with gasoline. Because Brazilian and U.S. ethanol prices have become linked, a change in Brazilian ethanol policy or a shock in world sugar markets can now impact U.S. ethanol and corn prices. We show that in theory, each policy analyzed has an ambiguous impact on ethanol and sugar prices. Empirically, however, a low gasoline tax and a high tax exemption for ethanol used in the fuel blend reduce ethanol and sugar prices; this contradicts conventional wisdom. Overall, we find that policy reforms implemented in 2010 offset the ethanol price increase by about 27% due to outward shifts in fuel transportation and sugar export demand curves, and due to a reduced sugarcane supply caused by bad weather. Our model illustrates the importance of Brazil's ethanol policies on world commodity markets; it also provides insight into how the Brazilian government can adjust policies to better control domestic inflation while minimizing impacts on investment.},

We find the price premium associated with the organic characteristic to be approximately 12 cents per jar. To the extent this premium reflects parents{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} preferences regarding the reduction of their baby{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s exposure to pesticide residues, our results could be paired up with risk data to estimate the value of the health benefits associated with reduced exposure.},

  Abstract                 = {Economically motivated adulteration (EMA) of food, also known as food fraud, is the intentional adulteration of food for financial advantage. A common form of EMA, undeclared substitution with alternative ingredients, is usually a health concern because of allergen labeling requirements. As demonstrated by the nearly 300,000 illnesses in China from melamine adulteration of infant formula, EMA also has the potential to result in serious public health consequences. Furthermore, EMA incidents reveal gaps in quality assurance testing methodologies that could be exploited for intentional harm. In contrast to foodborne disease outbreaks, EMA incidents present a particular challenge to the food industry and regulators because they are deliberate acts that are intended to evade detection. Large-scale EMA incidents have been described in the scientific literature, but smaller incidents have been documented only in media sources. We reviewed journal articles and media reports of EMA since 1980. We identified 137 unique incidents in 11 food categories: fish and seafood (24 incidents), dairy products (15), fruit juices (12), oils and fats (12), grain products (11), honey and other natural sweeteners (10), spices and extracts (8), wine and other alcoholic beverages (7), infant formula (5), plant-based proteins (5), and other food products (28). We identified common characteristics among the incidents that may help us better evaluate and reduce the risk of EMA. These characteristics reflect the ways in which existing regulatory systems or testing methodologies were inadequate for detecting EMA and how novel detection methods and other deterrence strategies can be deployed. Prevention and detection of EMA cannot depend on traditional food safety strategies. Comprehensive food protection, as outlined by the Food Safety Modernization Act, will require innovative methods for detecting EMA and for targeting crucial resources toward the riskiest food products.},

In contrast, biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on degraded and abandoned agricultural lands planted with perennials incur little or no carbon debt and can offer immediate and sustained GHG advantages.},

  Abstract                 = {The magnitude of land conversion caused by biofuels expansion largely determines whether biofuels reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. To examine this issue, we model how equilibrium changes in input use and land allocation decisions respond to market- and policy-induced increases in corn ethanol demand. We demonstrate why total cropland area unambiguously increases with increased ethanol demand. The impact of ethanol price subsidies and consumption mandates are examined in the context of technical change. If ethanol demand is elastic enough, an exogenous increase in corn yields leads to cropland expansion with price subsidies. Yield increases under consumption mandates reduce land use.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The extent to which Stated Choice (SC) experiments suffer from hypothetical bias continues to be a controversial topic in the literature. This research provides further evidence in this debate by examining the existence of hypothetical bias in a transport-related \{SC\} experiment. Data for this research were sourced from a University of Sydney study exploring the effect of exposure-based charging on motorist behaviour. The sample included 148 Sydney motorists who were recruited to take part in the 10-week \{GPS\} driving field study (Revealed Preference/RP data). In addition, participants were also required to complete an \{SC\} survey which was designed to mimic the \{RP\} decision context in order to capture what participants indicated they would do as opposed to what participants actually did in reaction to the charging regime. The current state of practice for measuring hypothetical bias in the literature is to compare aggregate differences in model outcomes using \{SC\} and \{RP\} data sources. Aggregate analysis is limited in its scope and does not allow for the calculation of the prevalence of hypothetical bias (i.e., how many participants are affected by hypothetical bias). This research is uniquely structured to allow for individual categorisation of hypothetical bias by comparing \{SC\} and \{RP\} data from the same sample for the direct purpose of investigating the prevalence of hypothetical bias. Furthermore, the extent to which mitigation techniques (cheap talk and certainty scales) influence hypothetical bias is also explored. The findings from this research show that the \{SC\} model estimates are prone to hypothetical bias and that the mitigation techniques have potential to compensate for this inherent bias. },

  Abstract                 = {Antitrust enforcement makes it difficult to test theories of cartel formation because most attempts to form cartels are blocked or kept secret. However, federal laws allow U.S. produce growers to operate marketing cartels through devices called "marketing orders." These cartels use quantity controls and quality standards to raise prices of fresh produce. Some growers have adopted marketing orders, and others have not. This paper develops and tests a positive theory of the adoption of marketing orders. The theory suggests that growers in a region are more likely to adopt a marketing order if the demand for fresh produce is inelastic, the growers' market share in the fresh market is large, there are barriers to entry and expansion, the fraction of the output the growers ship to the fresh market is not too large or too small, growers are homogeneous, and large cooperatives exist. Probit analyses support these hypotheses.},

Using survey data from 1,442 farmers, processors and retailers in six countries, the empirical relevance of several factors potentially influencing the choice of contract types and the sustainability of relationships is tested. In particular, the significance of quality orientation and the use of traceability schemes are explored. Market, industry and enterprise-specific characteristics are found to influence contract type choice while dyadic, firm-level factors appear to affect relationship sustainability. The results carry implications for agribusiness management, particularly regarding food safety standards, as well as policy support.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a conceptual framework for choosing the most cost-effective intervention along the supply chain to improve food safety. This framework identifies both the initial level of on-farm infection and the potential for new infection post farm-gate as key parameters influencing the relative effectiveness of on-farm and abattoir interventions. In addition, the potential for cost economies of scale in implementing interventions at abattoir compared to on-farm is shown to be a further factor determining the relative cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Overall, it is suggested by the analysis in this paper that successful abattoir interventions will typically be more cost-effective than successful on-farm interventions. These findings are consistent with existing case study evidence.},

The analysis also provides indications of useful forms for these functions, patterns of yield variation by age of tree, and the nonlinear relation of removal response to age of tree.},

  Abstract                 = {Efficiency in redistribution is measured in terms of deadweight loss generated per dollar of economic surplus transferred between consumers and producers of a commodity by means of market intervention. The implications of supply and demand elasticities for efficiency in redistribution are examined with special attention to the comparison of production control and deficiency payment programs. The results may be used to aid in the evaluation of commodity programs and as a basis for consideration of the hypothesis that observed policies are efficient, given the political power of interest groups.},

  Abstract                 = { We explore the widespread methodology of using demand information to infer market conduct and unobserved cost components under the hypothesis of static oligopoly behavior. Direct measures of marginal cost and conduct, indicating small market power, serve as benchmarks. The more competitive models yield better cost estimates. The best cost estimates occur when conduct is estimated as a free parameter, which in turn only slightly underestimates our direct measure. It also tracks the decline in market power accompanying the industry's structural changes. The methodology is largely validated, although partial cost information can improve its predictive power. Conclusions are robust to demand function.},

  Abstract                 = {Standard real business cycle models must rely on total factor productivity (TFP) shocks to explain the observed comovement of consumption, investment, and hours worked. This paper shows that a neoclassical model consistent with observed heterogeneity in labor supply and consumption can generate comovement in the absence of TFP shocks. Intertemporal substitution of goods and leisure induces comovement over the business cycle through heterogeneity in the consumption behavior of employed and unemployed workers. This result owes to two model features introduced to capture important characteristics of U.S. labor market data. First, individual consumption is affected by the number of hours worked: Employed agents consume more on average than the unemployed do. Second, changes in the employment rate, a central factor explaining variation in total hours, affect aggregate consumption. Demand shocks--such as shifts in the marginal efficiency of investment, as well as government spending shocks and news shocks--are shown to generate economic fluctuations consistent with observed business cycles.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper analyzes the use of storage and trade policies to achieve food price stabilization in a small open developing country. Optimal stabilization policies are identified using a rational expectations storage model with risk-averse consumers and incomplete markets. Without public intervention, price dynamics are driven by domestic productive shocks and international prices. On its own, an optimal storage policy is found to be detrimental to consumers because its stabilizing benefits leak to the world market. In contrast, an optimal combination of storage and trade policies results in a powerful stabilization of domestic food prices. However, such an optimal combination is shown to entail two serious drawbacks: its distributive impacts are large compared to its efficiency benefits, and by distorting excess supply curves, it may aggravate high world price episodes.},

Consumers are willing to pay more for counterfeits than for generic merchandise of similar quality because they value the prestige associated with brand-name trademarks. Counterfeiters of status goods impose a negative externality on consumers of genuine items, as fakes degrade the status associated with a given label. But counterfeits allow consumers to unbundle the status and quality attributes of the brand-name products, and alter the competition among oligopolistic trademark owners. We analyze two policies designed to combat counterfeiting: enforcement policy which increases the likelihood of confiscation of illegal items, and the imposition of a tariff on low-quality imports.},

The relationship between food safety and quality is addressed, and is discussed in the context of research on consumer risk perception. Quality and safety perception is linked to food choice and consumer demand, addressing questions of price perception and the validity of willingness-to-pay measurements. It is concluded that food quality and safety are central issues in today's food economics, though many research questions remain to be addressed.},

The second step uses maximum likelihood to measure excess capital capacity and evaluate the factors that influence it. The empirical application to Dutch cash crop farms found varying degrees of excess capital capacity. The policy implications of excess capital capacity are discussed.},

First, subjects underestimate the relatively low probabilities of food-borne illness. Second, measures of value are within a relatively flat range across a wide range of risks, even with repeated market experience and full information on the objective probability and severity of illness, suggesting subjects rely on prior perceptions. Third, marginal willingness to pay decreases as risk increases, suggesting that the perceived quality of new information can affect the weight the individuals place on the information. Finally, pathogen-specific values seem to act as surrogates for general food safety preferences.},

Data based on these household-expenditure surveys present a major estimation problem. For any given household, many of the goods have zero consumption, implying a censored dependent variable. Techniques which do not take this censored dependent variable into account will yield biased results. We utilize a censored regression approach that is computationally simple, consistent, and asymptotically efficient. The results are then presented and compared with those obtained using an uncensored technique.},

  Abstract                 = {We use field-level data to estimate the response of corn and soybean acreage to price shocks. Our sample contains more than 8 million observations derived from satellite imagery and includes every cultivated field in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana. We estimate that aggregate crop acreage responds more to price shocks in the short run than in the long run, and we show theoretically how the benefits of crop rotation generate this response pattern. In essence, farmers who change crops due to a price shock have an incentive to switch back to the previous crop to capture the benefits of crop rotation. Our result contradicts the long-held belief that agricultural supply responds gradually to price shocks through partial adjustment. We would not have obtained this result had we used county-level panel data. Standard econometric methods applied to county-level data produce estimates consistent with partial adjustment. We show that this apparent partial adjustment is illusory, and we demonstrate how it arises from the fact that fields in the same county are more similar to each other than to fields in other counties. This result underscores the importance of using models with appropriate micro-foundations and cautions against inferring micro-level rigidities from inertia in aggregate panel data. Our preferred estimate of the own-price long-run elasticity of corn acreage is 0.29, and the cross-price elasticity is -0.22. The corresponding elasticities for soybean acreage are 0.26 and -0.33. Our estimated short-run elasticities are 37% larger than their long-run counterparts.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a dynamic model to assess the effects of policy expectations on crop supply and illustrate the approach with estimates of the effects of base updating in U.S. crop programs. For corn and soybeans in the Corn Belt, the effect of base updating is relatively small because relevant crop alternatives are subject to similar policies and the alternatives are substitutes in production. Increasing acreage of one program crop to capture future payments from base updating reduces future payments from the alternative crop. We also use our model to assess the effect of base updating on acreage response to prices.},

  Abstract                 = {Crop yield shocks are partially predictable---high planting-time futures prices have tended to indicate that yield would be below trend. As a result, regressions of total caloric production on futures prices produce estimates of the supply elasticity that are biased downwards by up to 75%. Regressions of the world{\textquoteright}s growing area on futures prices have a much smaller bias of about 20% because although yield shocks are partially predictable, this predictability has a relatively small effect on land allocation. We argue that the preferred method for estimating the crop supply elasticity is to use regressions of growing area on futures prices and to include the realized yield shock as a control variable. An alternative method for bias reduction is to use instrumental variables (IVs). We show that the marginal contribution of an IV to bias reduction is small---IVs are not necessary for futures prices in supply analysis.},

Under the usual assumptions about preferences, the wealth and insurance effects of many support programs increase optimal input levels even for supposedly decoupled programs. If the program is {\textquotedblleft}coupled{\textquotedblright} in the usual sense, then all three effects often act in the same direction. It is concluded that studies of trade and domestic policy reform in stochastic environments should consider insurance and wealth effects. The derivative conditions required to obtain results are also subjected to scrutiny. Simulations for an Iowa corn producer confirm the comparative statics.},

  Abstract                 = {There is growing interest in establishing the extent of differences in willingness to pay (WTP) for attributes, such as travel time savings, that are derived from real market settings and hypothetical (to varying degrees) settings. Non-experiment external validity tests involving observation of choice activity in a natural environment, where the individuals do not know they are in an experiment, are rare. In contrast the majority of tests are a test of external validity between hypothetical and actual experiments. Deviation from real market evidence is referred to in the literature broadly as hypothetical bias. The challenge is to identify such bias, and to the extent to which it exists, establishing possible ways to minimise it. This paper reviews the efforts to date to identify and {\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textasciitilde}calibrate{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} \{WTP\} derived from one or more methods that involve assessment of hypothetical settings, be they (i) contingent valuation methods, (ii) choice experiments involving trading attributes between multiple alternatives, with or without referencing, or (iii) methods involving salient or non-salient incentives linked to actual behaviour. Despite progress in identifying possible contributions to differences in marginal WTP, there is no solid evidence, although plenty of speculation, to explain the differences between all manner of hypothetical experiments and non-experimental evidence. The absence of non-experimental evidence from natural field experiments remains a major barrier to confirmation of under or over-estimation. We find, however, that the role of referencing of an experiment relative to a real experience (including evidence from revealed preference (RP) studies), in the design of choice experiments, appears to offer promise in the derivation of estimates of \{WTP\} that have a meaningful link to real market activity, closing the gap between \{RP\} and \{SC\} \{WTP\} outputs. },

It fills an important gap in the literature by modeling the endogenous location of open space. The article compares open space decisions made under a majority-rules voting scheme with welfare-improving criterion and finds households tied to a location in space compete against each other for public goods located nearer them. Significant differences emerge between the two decision criteria, indicating that requiring referenda for open space decisions is likely to lead to inefficient outcomes. Specifically, many open space votes are likely to fail that would lead to welfare improvements, and any open space decisions that do pass will require amenities larger than needed to achieve the social optimum. The more dispersed and large the population, the larger is the gap between the socially efficient level and the level needed for a public referendum to pass.},

  Abstract                 = {{U.S. foodborne illness risk analysis would benefit greatly from better information on the relationship between the incidence of foodborne illness and exposure to foodborne pathogens. In this study, expert elicitation was used to attribute U.S. foodborne illnesses caused by the nine FoodNet pathogens, Toxoplasma gondii, and noroviruses to consumption of foods in 11 broad categories. Forty-two nationally recognized food safety experts responded to a formal written expert elicitation survey. For each pathogen, respondents gave their best estimate of the distribution of foodborne illnesses associated with each of the food categories and the 90\% confidence bounds on each of their estimates. Based on the work of Paul Mead and his coauthors, food attribution percentage estimates from this study were used to attribute case, hospitalization, and death incidence estimates to foods according to pathogen. These attribution estimates indicate that 15 food-pathogen pairs account for 90\% of the illnesses, 25 pairs account for 90\% of hospitalizations, and 21 pairs account for 90\% of deaths.}},

The concept of stationary equilibrium is introduced, extending long run industry equilibrium theory to account for entry, exit, and heterogeneity in the size and growth rate of firms. Conditions under which there will be entry and exit in the stationary equilibrium are given. Cross-sectional properties--across size and age cohorts--are analyzed and compared to the data. Implications for the equilibrium distributions of profits and the value of firms are analyzed. The effect of changes in the parameters describing the technological and market conditions of the industry on the equilibrium size distribution and turnover rates are also analyzed.},

However, elasticity estimates may be needed or wanted. The paper shows that, under rather general conditions, the reciprocal of the direct price flexibility is the lower absolute limit of the direct price elasticity. The departure of the true price elasticity from the flexibility reciprocal depends upon the strength of the cross effects of substitution and complementarity with other commodities.},

It discusses whether courts should protect consumers who do not comply with recalls. Under the "no duty to return" rule, the firm bears the same liability no matter whether it has made a recall or not. The firm then may not recall the product as often as socially desired or provide insufficient reimbursement for consumers' return costs. In contrast, the "full duty to return" rule denies the firm's future liabilities after it makes a recall. More consumers then return the product, which may reduce the firm's incentives to recall the product. We show that the "full duty to return" rule may or may not generate more product recalls or higher social welfare. We also discuss the "partial duty to return" rule, which partially reduces the firm's liability after it makes a recall.},

Fruit and vegetable harvest mechanization has several potential advantages: reduced harvest costs, eliminate problems associated with finding good quality harvest labor, permit longer harvesting days, and reduce exposure of harvest to human bacteria. Commercial mechanical harvesters for processed tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, carrots, tart cherries, apples, grapes, peaches, plums and grapes are in the hands of growers. To my surprise, considerable progress has been made on fresh market sweet cherry, apple and berry harvesters, and in the next few years commercial sales of these machines are expected. A negative shock to labor harvest-labor availability or jump in the harvester wage or piece rate could rapidly accelerate adoption of the best mechanical harvesting technologies by growers and processors.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a framework for analyzing transformations of demand. Such transformations frequently stem from changes in the dispersion of consumers' valuations, which lead to rotations of the demand curve. In many settings, profits are a U-shaped function of dispersion. High dispersion is complemented by niche production, and low dispersion is complemented by mass-market supply. We investigate numerous applications, including product design; advertising, marketing and sales advice; and the construction of quality-differentiated product lines. We also suggest a new taxonomy of advertising, distinguishing between hype, which shifts demand, and real information, which rotates demand.},

Firms that violate environmental laws suffer statistically significant losses in the market value of firm equity. The losses, however, are of similar magnitudes to the legal penalties imposed, and in the cross section, the market value loss is related to the size of the legal penalty. Thus, environmental violations are disciplined largely through legal and regulatory penalties, not through reputational penalties.},

My view, like Leamer's, is that there is no way to escape the role of assumptions in statistical work, so our conclusions will always be contingent. Hence, we should be circumspect about our degree of knowledge. I present some lessons for economics from the field of marketing, a field where broad consensus has been reached on many key issues over the past twenty years. In marketing, 1) the structural paradigm is dominant, 2) the data are a lot better than in some fields of economics, and 3) there is great emphasis on external validation. Of course, good data always helps. I emphasize that the ability to do controlled experiments does not obviate the need for theory, and finally I address different approaches to model validation.},

A controversial element of this debate is the role of crop yield growth as a means of avoiding cropland conversion in the face of biofuels growth. We find that standard assumptions of yield response are unduly restrictive. Furthermore, we identify both the acreage response and bilateral trade specifications as critical considerations for predicting global land use change. Sensitivity analysis reveals that each of these contributes importantly to parametric uncertainty.},

While most have postulated the Beta as a flexible alternative to the Normal, others have chosen nonparametric methods. Unfortunately, yield data tends not to be sufficiently abundant to invalidate many reasonable parametric models. This is problematic because conclusions from economic analyses, which require estimated conditional yield densities, tend not to be invariant to the modeling assumption. We propose a semiparametric estimator that, because of its theoretical properties and our simulation results, enables one to empirically proceed with a higher degree of confidence.},

  Abstract                 = { Who benefits from agricultural subsidies is an open question. Economic theory predicts that the entire subsidy incidence should be on the farmland owners. Using a complementary set of policy quasi experiments, I find that farmers who rent the land they cultivate capture 75 percent of the subsidy, leaving just 25 percent for landowners. This finding contradicts the prediction from neoclassical models. The standard prediction may not hold because of less than perfect competition in the farmland rental market; the share captured by landowners increases with local measures of competitiveness in the farmland rental market.

  Abstract                 = {A partial-equilibrium, two-country model is developed to analyze implications from the introduction of genetically modified (GM) products. In the model, innovators hold proprietary rights, farmers are (competitive) adopters, some consumers deem GM food to be inferior in quality to traditional food, and the mere introduction of GM crops affects the costs of non-GM food (because of costly identity preservation). Among the results derived, it is shown that, although GM innovations have the potential to improve efficiency, some groups can be made worse off. Indeed, it is even possible that the costs induced by GM innovations outweigh the efficiency gains.},

  Abstract                 = {Economists have devoted relatively little attention to analyzing how government officials actually enforce regulation. This is a significant omission, since the efficacy of regulatory enforcement and the effects of regulation on economic outcomes may depend on how regulators regulate. This article sheds light on these issues by examining how the fledgling Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforced the Pure Food and Drugs Act from 1907 to 1938. I argue that because the FDA's ability to enforce this law through deterrence was limited, effective enforcement could be obtained only in those instances where the agency had the capacity to offer benefits to compliant firms in the way of quality certification or direct assistance in improving product quality. The available evidence on the FDA's enforcement activities is consistent with this prediction. The analysis presented may help to explain why contemporary regulatory agencies spend considerable resources on advisory enforcement activities.},

  Abstract                 = { My first reaction to "The Credibility Revolution in Empirical Economics," authored by Joshua D. Angrist and J{\"{o}}rn-Steffen Pischke, was: Wow! This paper makes a stunningly good case for relying on purposefully randomized or accidentally randomized experiments to relieve the doubts that afflict inferences from nonexperimental data. On further reflection, I realized that I may have been overcome with irrational exuberance. Moreover, with this great honor bestowed on my "con" article, I couldn't easily throw this child of mine overboard. As Angrist and Pischke persuasively argue, either purposefully randomized experiments or accidentally randomized "natural" experiments can be extremely helpful, but Angrist and Pischke seem to me to overstate the potential benefits of the approach. I begin with some thoughts about the inevitable limits of randomization, and the need for sensitivity analysis in this area, as in all areas of applied empirical work. I argue that the recent financial catastrophe is a powerful illustration of the fact that extrapolating from natural experiments will inevitably be hazardous. I discuss how the difficulties of applied econometric work cannot be evaded with econometric innovations, offering as examples some under-recognized difficulties with instrumental variables and robust standard errors. I conclude with comments about the shortcomings of an experimentalist paradigm as applied to macroeconomics, and some warnings about the willingness of applied economists to apply push-button methodologies without sufficient hard thought regarding their applicability and shortcomings.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides general conditions for aggregating commodities without separable utility. These conditions impose weaker and more empirically plausible restrictions on price movements than the currently existing alternative to separability, the Hicks-Leontief composite commodity theorem. The idea is to allow departures from Hicks-Leontief that take the form of well behaved error terms. Utility functions that permit generalized composite commodity aggregation include the AIDS model, the translog, all homothetic utility functions, and any utility function when demands are aggregated to two groups of goods. Implications of empirical nonstationarity of relative prices for aggregation and demand estimation are considered.},

A consumer survey was mailed in spring and early summer 2003 to households in the continental United States. Results indicate that consumers are in general very concerned about food safety issues, viewing U.S. meats as the safest among the selection of countries considered. Nevertheless, consumer willingness to pay for Certified U.S. products is relatively small, although above the expected implementation costs associated with a mandatory labeling program. This finding coincides with the fact that only 36\% of the sample favored consumers paying directly for the costs related to a mandatory COOL program.},

This analysis presents an equilibrium displacement model of the farm, wholesale, and retail markets for beef, pork, and poultry that documents how producers and consumers will be affected by COOL. Findings reveal that as the costs of COOL are shifted from the producer to the processor and retailer, producers are made increasingly better off while consumers are made increasingly worse off. Further, an increase in aggregate consumer demand of 2\% to 3\% is likely sufficient to offset lost producer welfare due to COOL costs.},

This paper brings to the attention of agricultural economists a sizable body of literature on country-of-origin effects from the marketing and business disciplines. Based on this literature, we draw a distinction between several consumer motivations for origin labels and we identify which of these is cause for public policy. We propose several research questions that require answers if the consequences of country-of-origin labeling policy are to be fully understood.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes an analytically tractable model of balanced growth that is consistent with the observed size distribution of firms. Growth is the result of idiosyncratic firm productivity improvements, selection of successful firms, and imitation by entrants. Selection tends to improve aggregate productivity at a fast rate if entry and imitation are easy. The empirical phenomenon of Zipf's law can be interpreted to mean that entry costs are high or that imitation is difficult, or both. The small size of entrants indicates that imitation must be difficult. A calibration based on U. S. data suggests that about half of output growth can be attributed to selection. But the implied variance of the combined preference and technology shocks is puzzlingly high.},

We propose that a long-run no-profit condition is established in distant futures markets for ethanol, corn and natural gas and then use the theory of storage to define an inter-temporal equilibrium among these prices. The relationship shows that under certain conditions, future price expectations will influence nearby futures prices and that a short-term relationship between input and output prices will exist. We demonstrate validity of the theory using a structural price model and then by means of time-series techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We extend the economic theory of regulation to allow for strategic self-regulation that preempts political action. When political entr is costly for consumers, firms can deter it through voluntary restraints. Unlike standard entry models, deterrence is achieved by overinvesting to raise the rival's welfare in the event of entry. Empirical evidence on releases of toxic chemicals shows that an increased threat of regulation (as proxied by increased membership in conservation groups) indeed induces firms to reduce toxic releases. We establish conditions under which self-regulation, if it occurs, is a Pareto improvement once costs of influencing policy are included.},

We adopt a methodological extension to the ES approach which enables the detection of significant response under date uncertainty. The application measures the impact of European Commission Regulation 1881/2006 and the English Contaminants in Food Regulation 2007 on 30 food securities listed in the London Stock Exchange.},

This article analyses the incentives for setting private quality standards before governments do so. Since food quality standards are generally multifaceted, different types of standards will affect revenues differently. Our model shows that private firms can pre-empt public regulation by setting their own private food quality standards in order to choose the type of standards that minimises their costs. The emergence of private food standards in grocery retailing is discussed in this context.},

Known pathogens account for an estimated 14 million illnesses, 60, 000 hospitalizations, and 1,800 deaths. Three pathogens, Salmonella, Listeria, and Toxoplasma, are responsible for 1,500 deaths each year, more than 75\% of those caused by known pathogens, while unknown agents account for the remaining 62 million illnesses, 265,000 hospitalizations, and 3,200 deaths. Overall, foodborne diseases appear to cause more illnesses but fewer deaths than previously estimated.}},

  Abstract                 = {The US egg industry is being pressured from many directions to change its production practices, particularly to address concerns about hen welfare in conventional cage systems. Responding to similar pressures, in 1999, the European Union banned conventional laying cages starting in 2012. This now impending European ban has led to the development of several alternative housing systems. These include noncage systems like aviaries and modified (enriched or furnished) cages that include perches, areas in which the hens can forage and dustbathe, and nests. Understanding the European experience is valuable as the United States considers the future direction of the egg industry. In the United States, the proportion of eggs produced in alternative systems is small (less than 5% of output) but growing, in part due to market and political incentives for systems that provide hens with more behavioral freedom than conventional cages. Animal welfare, however, is only one element of a sustainable production system. Other elements include those related to public values, the environment, economics, worker health, and food safety and quality. Eggs are a primary source of animal protein globally, and the United States is the third largest producer of eggs in the world, behind China and the European Union. The national table egg flock comprises about 280 million hens housed in all regions but with approximately 60% of eggs produced in the 10 leading states. Adopting new housing systems will have substantial effects on costs and other aspects of egg production on both a regional and national scale, with some positive effects but also potential negative effects that need to be carefully considered. This paper discusses the US egg industry in the context of legislation and standards related to hen housing systems. It also addresses initiatives by retailers, nongovernmental organizations, and private certification organizations to shape production practices in the egg industry as well as how those initiatives might affect various aspects of the sustainability of egg production.},

Unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for using a correlated random effects specification and a generalized method of moments framework used to estimate the model. While relatively small differences in elasticity estimates are found between a flexible random effects specification and one that restricts the random effect coefficient to be time invariant, larger differences are observed when comparing the flexible model to a pooled cross-sectional estimator. The results suggest the limited ability of such estimators to control for preference heterogeneity and unit-value endogeneity leads to parameter bias.},

The le Chatelier effects of supply constraints are illustrated, and the comparative statics of supply management is shown to depend, under input normality, on the type of jointness. Convexity is tested and accepted, and nonjointness is rejected by the estimated normalized quadratic profit function. The results support the hypothesis of nonjointness due to allocatable fixed factors. Decreasing the supply of managed commodities will increase the supply of unrestricted commodities, while total input use is reduced.},

The analysis emphasizes vertical market linkages whereby agricultural innovations adopted by farmers are produced upstream by input suppliers. It is argued that the conventional assumption of competitive pricing cannot hold when new technologies are produced by private firms because such innovations are typically protected by intellectual property rights (such as patents) that confer (limited) monopoly rights to discoverers. The implications of intellectual property rights for the welfare evaluation of agricultural R&D are derived, and it is shown that conventional methods usually overestimate the welfare gains from agricultural innovations.},

This is followed by a basic analysis of agricultural production decisions under risk, including some comparative statics results from stylized models. Selected empirical topics are surveyed, with emphasis on risk analyses as they pertain to production decisions at the farm level. Risk management is then discussed, and a synthesis of hedging models is presented. We conclude with a detailed review of agricultural insurance, with emphasis on the moral hazard and adverse selection problems that arise in the context of crop insurance. },

  Abstract                 = { Without a doubt, there has been a "credibility revolution" in applied econometrics. One contributing development has been in the improvement and increased use in data analysis of "structural methods"; that is, the use of models based in economic theory. Structural modeling attempts to us data to identify the parameters of an underlying economic model, based on models of individual choice or aggregate relations derived from them. Structural estimation has a long tradition in economics, but better and larger data sets, more powerful computers, improved modeling methods, faster computational techniques, and new econometric methods such as those mentioned above have allowed researchers to make significant improvements. While Angrist and Pischke extol the successes of empirical work that estimates "treatment effects" based on actual or quasi-experiments, they are much less sanguine about structural analysis and hold industrial organization up as an example where "progress is less dramatic." Indeed, reading their article one comes away with the impression that there is only a single way to conduct credible empirical analysis. This seems to us a very narrow and dogmatic approach to empirical work; credible analysis can come in many guises, both structural and nonstructural, and for some questions structural analysis offers important advantages. In this comment, we address the criticism of structural analysis and its use in industrial organization, and consider why empirical analysis in industrial organization differs in such striking ways from that in field such as labor, which have recently emphasized the methods favored by Angrist and Pischke.},

  Abstract                 = {Economic theories of managing renewable resources, such as fisheries and forestry, traditionally assume that individual harvesters are perfectly rational and thus able to compute the harvesting strategy that maximizes their discounted profits. The current paper presents an alternative approach based on bounded rationality and evolutionary mechanisms. It is assumed that individual harvesters face a choice between two harvesting strategies. The evolution of the distribution of strategies in the population is modeled through a replicator dynamics equation. The latter captures the idea that strategies yielding above average profits are demanded more than strategies yielding below average profits, so that the first type ends up accounting for a larger part in the population. From a mathematical perspective, the combination of resource and evolutionary processes leads to complex dynamics. The paper presents the existence and stability conditions for each steady-state of the system and analyzes dynamic paths to the equilibrium. In addition, effects of changes in prices are analyzed. A main result of the paper is that under certain conditions both strategies can survive in the long-run.<P>This discussion paper has resulted in a publication in the <A href=\&quot;http://www.springerlink.com/content/t1ltvg264rknpv90/?p=30a728e4ed6147c687abc037f29e3c4a\&pi=4\&quot;><I>Journal of Evolutionary Economics</I></A>, 2003, 13(2), 183-200.},

  Abstract                 = { Many researchers and commentators underestimate the length and importance of the time lags between initial research investment and ultimate impacts on the development and adoption of technological innovations. In both econometric studies of productivity and ex post and ex ante benefit-cost evaluations of research investments, researchers typically impose untested assumptions about the R\&D lag, which can have profound implications for the results. In this paper we present a range of evidence on agricultural R\&D lags including both aggregative analysis of U.S. agricultural productivity using time series data, and some specific details on the timelines for the research, development, and adoption processes for particular mechanical and biological innovations in U.S. agriculture. The aggregative analysis makes use of a comparatively rich state-level data set on U.S. agriculture that makes it possible to test hypotheses about the R\&D lag and to evaluate the implications for the specification of models of production and for findings regarding the rate of return to public research investments. The results support the use of a longer lag with a different shape than is typically imposed in studies of industrial R\&D. These findings are supported by the timelines for specific technological innovations, including new crop varieties, as well as tractors and other mechanical innovations.},

The model shows how either changing feedback from constituents or changing regulatory costs can alter the trade-offs facing the agency and hence create opportunities for substitution among different agency actions. This framework is used to explain the changing portfolio of FDA enforcement actions between 1972-92. Results indicate that changing constituent and political feedback is the reason for the observed policy change. Specifically, budget reductions and increasing industry demand for product approval led the FDA to reduce monitoring and substitute less resource-intensive enforcement, namely recalls, for more resource-intensive enforcement. Results also show that increasing numbers of adverse drug reaction reports from consumers and physicians enabled the agency to increase the efficiency of its inspections policy and to ultimately reduce its use of inspections.},

  Abstract                 = { Increasing size of establishments and resulting concentration in U.S. industries may stem from various types of cost economies. In particular, scale economies arising from technological factors embodied in plant and equipment may be a driving force for such market structure changes. In this case, typical market power measures like Lerner indices can be misleading: if scale (cost) economies prevail, cost efficiencies rather than market deficiencies may actually underlie the observed patterns. In this study, I provide measures of scale economies and market power for the U.S. meat packing industry, whose increased consolidation and concentration have raised great concern in policy circles. The results suggest that this trend has been motivated by cost economies, but that little excess profitability exists, and on the margin the potential for taking further advantage of such economies has become minimal. {\copyright} 2001 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technolog},

  Abstract                 = {In 1996, President Clinton signed into law the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). The act reduces the historic role economic benefits play in determining whether known carcinogenic pesticides should be granted crop labels. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) now considers pesticide benefits only if at least one of two conditions is present: (a) the pesticide protects consumers against adverse health effects that are greater than the health risks posed by the pesticide itself, and (b) the pesticide is needed to prevent a {\textquotedblleft}significant disruption in [the] domestic production of an adequate, wholesome and economical food supply.{\textquotedblright} Congress cited an administrative action taken by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an example of the type of situation that legitimately might represent a potential {\textquotedblleft}significant disruption{\textquotedblright} of our food supply. The action raised the recommended ceilings for a dangerous carcinogenic mycotoxin, called aflatoxin, to reduce its impact on the availability of field corn. However, it is uncertain whether the corn/aflatoxin incident is a clear-cut example of a {\textquotedblleft}significant disruption{\textquotedblright} of our food supply. Evidence suggests that it might not be, as a drought had already destroyed a large part of the crop, and aflatoxin testing methods were inadequate. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether a strong nexus exists between crop losses caused by aflatoxin and crop losses suffered following the removal of pesticides. Several pesticide/crop combinations suggest that the nexus is not strong. The act would be more effective if economists estimated the unique crop-loss threshold for each pesticide/crop combination.},

Although nested tests and out-of-sample forecasting performance favor generalizing models to a certain degree, statistically insignificant improvements to in-sample-fit and even poorer out-of-sample forecast accuracy undermine further generalizations. Based on a subset of preferred models, FAFH is found to be price and income elastic compared to FAH which is price and income inelastic.},

To identify and prioritize successful food safety interventions, it is important to attribute the burden of human illness to the specific sources.

  Abstract                 = {This article introduces a resampling procedure called the stationary bootstrap as a means of calculating standard errors of estimators and constructing confidence regions for parameters based on weakly dependent stationary observations. Previously, a technique based on resampling blocks of consecutive observations was introduced to construct confidence intervals for a parameter of the m-dimensional joint distribution of m consecutive observations, where m is fixed. This procedure has been generalized by constructing a "blocks of blocks" resampling scheme that yields asymptotically valid procedures even for a multivariate parameter of the whole (i.e., infinite-dimensional) joint distribution of the stationary sequence of observations. These methods share the construction of resampling blocks of observations to form a pseudo-time series, so that the statistic of interest may be recalculated based on the resampled data set. But in the context of applying this method to stationary data, it is natural to require the resampled pseudo-time series to be stationary (conditional on the original data) as well. Although the aforementioned procedures lack this property, the stationary procedure developed here is indeed stationary and possesses other desirable properties. The stationary procedure is based on resampling blocks of random length, where the length of each block has a geometric distribution. In this article, fundamental consistency and weak convergence properties of the stationary resampling scheme are developed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we propose and estimate a new single-product cost function, the CES-translog. Like the translog, it is a flexible functional form, but it is compatible with a wider range of substitution possibilities than either the CES or the translog. As its name suggests, the CES-translog includes both the CES and the translog as special cases and thus permits nested testing using conventional statistical techniques. We estimate the new form and its special cases under a standard modeling scenario using eight data sets and find it significantly superior to the translog in all but one.},

We show the relationships between traceability and the level of food safety with many identical small farms in a competitive industry and for an industry using collective action to set rules and standards.},

This paper estimates econometrically differential market impacts of mandatory \{COOL\} on cattle raised in Canada and imported into the United States. We find significant evidence of differential impacts of \{COOL\} through widening of the price bases and a decline in ratios of imports to total domestic use for both fed and feeder cattle. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Consumption of high-ethanol gasoline blends must increase if United States renewable biofuel mandates are to rise above current levels as envisioned by the Renewable Fuel Standard. One such blend is \{E85\} which contains no more than 85% ethanol and no less than 15% gasoline. We derive the demand for \{E85\} based on a model of motorists' preferences for motor fuel blends and calibrate the demand for \{E85\} using data on the location of flex vehicles and fuel stations that sell \{E85\} in the United States. We also show how limits on the capacity of fuel stations to sell \{E85\} affect demand and explore the potential future demand for \{E85\} by increasing the number of fuel stations offering \{E85\} and the number of flex vehicles. We show that the existing fleet of flex vehicles is sufficient to accommodate more than 15&#xa0;billion&#xa0;gallons of ethanol without a large price discount on \{E85\} only if the number of stations that sell \{E85\} increases substantially. Provided with fast enough installation of new \{E85\} pumps, this level of consumption would be sufficient to meet the mandates envisioned for conventional ethanol by 2015. },

We find that for the currently commercial biofuels, inclusion of \{ILUC\} emissions as part of the policy rating of biofuels' \{GHG\} intensity: (i) likely leads to lower emissions; (ii) leads to greater reduction in both domestic and global oil consumption; (iii) leads to higher price of fuels in the home region; all compared to when \{ILUC\} emissions are excluded from the policy rating; and (iv) does not, however, ensure that emissions absolutely decline, owing to fuel market effects, which, unlike ILUC, are presently excluded from all existing fuel \{GHG\} regulations. Sensitivity analysis suggests that \{ILUC\} emissions and the price elasticity of oil supply are the greatest contributors to variance in net global \{GHG\} emissions under any given policy.},

Using an integrated epidemiological-economic model, this article demonstrates a methodology that captures the dynamic and spatial effects of animal disease. The model is applied to foot-and-mouth disease in the Southern Cone of South America. The results demonstrate the benefits of spatially sensitive policies in which certain regions within the Southern Cone employ different, coordinated interventions. Further, they highlight policy relevant differences between the dominant short-run and long-run control options.},

In this paper, we use a unique cross-section, time-series data set from North Carolina to quantify the welfare effects of transfer restrictions for poundage quota under the U.S. flue-cured tobacco program. We find that the deadweight costs of such restrictions are small but that the distributional effects are substantial. We analyze congressional testimony on quota transfer legislation and conclude that our estimates of the distributional effects are consistent with expressed views of market participants.},

  Abstract                 = { The EU policy on voluntary food labeling emphasizes the geographical origin of the products. Specialty products from a given area (e.g., wine) benefit from a reputation premium that is well-identified by consumers. Public authorities allow exclusive use of the appellation to a group of producers in exchange for commitments on production techniques, certification and control, and obligation of a collective use of the name. In spite of many successful aspects, the future of this policy is uncertain in a globalized environment. Caveats in the regulation (moral hazard, bureaucracy), lack of international readability of the labels, and competition from registered brand names are the main limitations of the EU policy.},

  Abstract                 = { The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) which was signed into law in January, 2011 represents a major initiative to improve food safety in the US. The legislation mandates the US Food and Drug Administration with developing a regulatory system to implement the Act. As yet, the full effect of the Act cannot be evaluated because the regulatory requirements are yet to be developed. There is little doubt, however, that those firms, both domestic and foreign, that wish to supply US consumers with food will face a considerable increase in regulatory costs. This paper outlines the major requirements of the FSMA and suggests how the regulatory burden may fall on foreign versus US domestic suppliers. Areas where Canadian firms may be disadvantaged relative to US firms are outlined. Opportunities that may arise from the FSMA for Canadian agri-food firms are discussed, as are the areas where the FSMA may not conform with the international trade commitments of the United States.},

Considering two symmetric retailers that are exclusively supplied by a finite number of producers and endogenizing the suppliers{\textquoteright} delivery choice, we show that there exist two asymmetric equilibria in the retailers{\textquoteright} quality requirements. Our results reveal that the retailers use private quality standards to improve their bargaining position in the intermediate goods market.

This study uses 1986 and 1987 Kansas feeder cattle auction data to investigate the impact of a wide variety of physical characteristics, many of which have not been used in previous studies on feeder cattle prices. Unlike previous studies, this analysis explicitly incorporates changes in feeder cattle market fundamentals during the data collection period and also allows price differentials to vary by sex and weight. Weight, weight-squared, lot size, lot size-squared, health, muscling, frame size, condition, fill, breed, presence of horns, and time of sale are significant factors affecting feeder cattle prices on any given day. Several physical traits also exhibit different seasonal price impacts.},

  Abstract                 = {Voluntary approaches have become a popular in the U.S. to enhance the efficacy and scope of existing regulations and to reduce emissions in sectors or for pollutants where formal environmental regulation is lacking. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of a particular EPA voluntary program for the metal finishing industry, the Strategic Goals Program (SGP). The Strategic Goals Program is a good candidate for evaluation because it had a credible regulatory threat at the time the program was implemented, we can measure both baseline emissions and progress towards explicit environmental goals, and we have data for participants and non-participants. We look at the decision to participate in the SGP and also try to determine what effect, if any, this program has had on the pollution profile of facilities. In addition, we examine whether the voluntary program had any discernible impact on toxicity-weighted emissions. Finally, we explore the possibility that we have a bimodal distribution in the sample caused by the different motivations of facilities to join a voluntary program. A number of factors influence a firm{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s decision to participate in SGP, including trade group membership. However, we do not find robust evidence that SGP participation has had a significant impact on emission reductions. This result continues to hold when we adjust emissions to account for toxicity. Our measure of the threat of regulation is correlated with emission reductions for both participants and non-participants.},

  Abstract                 = {A major econometric issue in estimating production parameters and technical efficiency is the possibility that some forces influencing production are only observed by the firm and not by the econometrician. Not only can this misspecification lead to a biased inference on the output elasticity of inputs, but it also provides a faulty measure of technical efficiency. We extend the Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) approach and provide an estimation algorithm to overcome the problem of endogenous input choice in stochastic production frontier estimation by generating consistent estimates of production parameters and technical efficiency. We apply the proposed method to a plant-level panel dataset from the Colombian food manufacturing sector for the period 1982–1998. This dataset provides the value of output and prices charged for each product, expenditures, and prices paid for each material used, energy consumption in kilowatt per hour and energy prices, number of workers and payroll, and book values of capital stock. Empirical results find that the traditional stochastic production frontier tends to underestimate the output elasticity of capital and firm-level technical efficiency. The evidence in this research suggests that addressing the endogeneity issue matters in stochastic production frontier analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper tests the conjecture that the divergence of willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) for identical goods is driven by the degree of substitution between goods. In contrast to well-known results for market goods with close substitutes (i.e., candy bars and coffee mugs), our results indicate a convergence of WTP and WTA measures of value. However, for a nonmarket good with imperfect substitutes (i.e., reduced health risk), the divergence of WTP and WTA value measures is persistent, even with repeated market participation and full information on the nature of the good.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers estimation and hypothesis testing in linear time series models when some or all of the variables have unit roots. Our motivating example is a vector autoregression with some unit roots in the companion matrix, which might include polynomials in time as regressors. In the general formulation, the variable might be integrated or cointegrated of arbitrary orders, and might have drifts as well. We show that parameters that can be written as coefficients on mean zero, nonintegrated regressors have jointly normal asymptotic distributions, converging at the rate T<sup>1/2</sup>. In general, the other coefficients (including the coefficients on polynomials in time) will have nonnormal asymptotic distributions. The results provide a formal characterization of which t or F tests--such as Granger causality tests--will be asymptotically valid, and which will have nonstandard limiting distributions.},

  Abstract                 = { The fact is, economics is not an experimental science and cannot be. "Natural" experiments and "quasi" experiments are not in fact experiments. They are rhetorical devices that are often invoked to avoid having to confront real econometric difficulties. Natural, quasi-, and computational experiments, as well as regression discontinuity design, can all, when well applied, be useful, but none are panaceas. The essay by Angrist and Pischke, in its enthusiasm for some real accomplishments in certain subfields of economics, makes overbroad claims for its favored methodologies. What the essay says about macroeconomics is mainly nonsense. Consequently, I devote the central part of my comment to describing the main developments that have helped take some of the con out of macroeconomics. Recent enthusiasm for single-equation, linear, instrumental variables approaches in applied microeconomics has led many in these fields to avoid undertaking research that would require them to think formally and carefully about the central issues of nonexperimental inference -- what I see and many see as the core of econometrics. Providing empirically grounded policy advice necessarily involves confronting these difficult central issues.},

In this study we use a regression-discontinuity framework and exploit the size threshold of federal and state rules targeting large-scale livestock operations to examine whether facilities adjust size to avoid regulation. We find statistical evidence of avoidance, primarily by operations entering at sizes just below the threshold.},

  Abstract                 = { Angrist and Pischke highlight one aspect of the research that has positively transformed econometric practice and teaching. They emphasize the rise of experiments and quasi-experiments as credible sources of identification in microeconometric studies, which they usefully term "design-based research." But in so doing, they miss an important part of the story: a second research strand aimed at developing tools for inference that are robust to subsidiary modeling assumptions. My first aim in these remarks therefore is to highlight some key developments in this area. I then turn to Angrist and Pischke's call for adopting experiments and quasi-experiments in macroeconometrics; while sympathetic, I suspect the scope for such studies is limited. I conclude with some observations on the current debate about whether experimental methods have gone too far in abandoning economic theory.},

This study uses a log-linear equilibrium displacement model, parameter estimates from prior studies, and recent data to indicate quantitative effects. International trade implies that the effect of the tax increase on the price of domestic tobacco will be small, even in the case of fixed tobacco quotas. However, the effects on tobacco producers' revenue, quota lease rates, and producer economic rents can be significant, depending on the response of U.S. tobacco policy to a tax change.},

  Abstract                 = {Unlike the federal milk marketing order system, California's system includes a milk quota program. Oddly, this quota restricts neither production nor marketing. In aggregate, the quota program leads to more milk production than a typical marketing quota, but less milk than blend pricing without the quota. The California program generates more producer surplus and smaller welfare losses than a federal-style program without quota. When class 1 milk sales expand, production expands less under the quota program than with blend pricing without a quota. Finally, increases in aggregate quota lower production because they lower the marginal price of milk facing producers.},

Some early authors appreciated that such policies created problems in markets for commodities and inputs. Over time, our understanding of agricultural issues and policies has deepened. Through the application of improved models and tools of analysis to more extensive data, we have developed better answers to old questions, and have responded to changing policy instruments, market contexts, and policy concerns. This article traces the evolution of our deepening economic understanding of the causes and consequences of agricultural policy.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional cage housing for laying hens evolved as a cost-effective egg production system. Complying with mandated hen housing alternatives would raise marginal production costs and require sizable capital investment. California data indicate that shifts from conventional cages to barn housing would likely cause farm-level cost increases of about 40% per dozen. The US data on production costs of such alternatives as furnished cages are not readily available and European data are not applicable to the US industry structure. Economic analysis relies on key facts about production and marketing of conventional and noncage eggs. Even if mandated by government or buyers, shifts to alternative housing would likely occur with lead times of at least 5 yr. Therefore, egg producers and input suppliers would have considerable time to plan new systems and build new facilities. Relatively few US consumers now pay the high retail premiums required for nonconventional eggs from hens housed in alternative systems. However, data from consumer experiments indicate that additional consumers would also be willing to pay some premium. Nonetheless, current data do not allow easy extrapolation to understand the willingness to pay for such eggs by the vast majority of conventional egg consumers. Egg consumption in the United States tends to be relatively unresponsive to price changes, such that sustained farm price increases of 40% would likely reduce consumption by less than 10%. This combination of facts and relationships suggests that, unless low-cost imports grew rapidly, requirements for higher cost hen housing systems would raise US egg prices considerably while reducing egg consumption marginally. Eggs are a low-cost source of animal protein and low-income consumers would be hardest hit. However, because egg expenditures are a very small share of the consumer budget, real income loss for consumers would be small in percentage terms. Finally, the high egg prices imposed by alternative hen housing systems raise complex issues about linking public policy costs to policy beneficiaries.},

In general, some producer and consumer interests are translated through markets and are mediated by market mechanisms, whereas others are poorly reflected by economic behavior. An array of survey and focus group research has been performed to elicit consumer and activist beliefs about performance goals they would expect from an egg production system. These studies provide evidence that consumers' market behavior may be at odds with their ethical and political beliefs about performance goals.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the implications of loss aversion for trade policy determination and show how it allows us to explain a number of important and puzzling features of trade policy. Some important questions concerning trade policy are why a disproportionate share of protection goes to declining industries and why trade policy has an anti-trade bias. We show that if individual preferences exhibit sufficient loss aversion, higher protection will be given to sectors in which profitability is declining. We also show that if the coefficient of loss aversion is large enough, there will be an anti-trade bias in trade policy. Using a nonlinear regression procedure, we find support for the model and the estimates of the loss aversion parameters are very close to those obtained by Kahneman and Tversky (Kahneman, D., Tversky, A., 1992. Advances in Prospect Theory: Cumulative Representation of Uncertainty. Journal of Risk and Uncertainty 5, 297{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}323.) with experimental data. Protection is found to be more responsive to losses than to gains, and the estimates of the coefficient of loss aversion are about 2. We also find evidence of loss aversion in lobby formation.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract SP-off-RP questions are a recent innovation in choice modelling that solicits information from respondents in a different way than standard stated-preference (SP) experiments. In particular, the alternatives and choice of a respondent in a real-world setting are observed, and the respondent is asked whether he/she would choose the same alternative or switch to another alternative if the attributes of the chosen alternative were less desirable in ways specified by the researcher and/or the attributes of non-chosen alternatives were more desirable in specified ways. This construction, called stated-preference off revealed-preference (SP-off-RP), is intended to increase the realism of the stated-preference task, relative to standard \{SP\} exercises, but creates endogeneity. In this paper, we present a series of Monte Carlo exercises that explore estimation on this type of data, using an estimator that accounts for the endogeneity. The results indicate that, when the variance in the processing error by respondents is the same for SP-off-RP data as for standard \{SP\} data, the two solicitation methods provide about the same level of efficiency in estimation, even though the SP-off-RP data contain endogeneity that the estimator must handle while the \{SP\} data do not involve endogeneity. For both solicitation methods, efficiency rises, as expected, as the variance of the processing error decreases. These results imply that, if respondents are able to answer SP-off-RP questions more accurately than standard \{SP\} questions (and hence have lower variance of processing error), then SP-off-RP data are more efficient that standard \{SP\} data. This implication needs to be viewed cautiously, since (i) the actual processing error for each solicitation method is not measured in the current study, and (ii) the results are for the specific data generation processes that are used in the Monte Carlo exercises.},

The results show that consumers pay substantial premiums for honey based on form, container, brand, and floral source. The highest price premiums are associated with unique monofloral sources, followed by other unusual, but less pure, floral sources. The results demonstrate that consumers will pay for unique characteristics of honeys associated with particular floral sources. Thus, honey producers may be able to further promote honey products or develop new products on the basis of floral source differentiation. {\copyright} 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {This article investigates the relationship between international trade patterns and the global distribution of coarse grain production responses to market developments in the United States. Our null hypothesis is that world markets are fully integrated, rendering the geographic persistence of bilateral trade flows irrelevant in the global production response to a change in U.S. prices. The alternative hypothesis allows price transmission to vary along with the intensity of competition among countries in specific markets. Using data from 1975 to 2002, we reject the null hypothesis. Our work has direct implications for the analysis of the global land use impacts of biofuel mandates.},

This note examines the possibility of quality certification as an alternative to exit from the market in such situations. Examples dealing with labor market uncertainties illustrate the economic properties of the quality certification process, which unravels from the top down. The economic motivations and patterns of this form of price discrimination are similar to those encountered in standard "lemons" models.},

RIN price behavior tends to follow theoretical expectations, but some notable exceptions occur, the causes of which remain uncertain. Information provided by RIN prices is used to test the implications of a binding renewable fuel standard (RFS) versus a nonbinding RFS on ethanol-gasoline and corn-gasoline price relationships. In certain cases, cointegration tests provide evidence that the relationships are weaker when the RFS mandates are believed to be binding.},

This paper presents an alternative method to estimate \{VOT\} by analyzing an hourly dataset on drivers speeding behavior as a function of the gasoline price. Our identification strategy is novel as it is based on the intensive margin. In comparison, previous studies reveal \{VOT\} on the extensive margin, but choice alternatives have multiple attributes thereby potentially confounding estimates. Consistent with the range of the prior literature, we find a \{VOT\} of about 50% of the wage rate and analyze sources of bias from accidents and traffic tickets. These bias functions suggest that previous stated preference \{VOT\} estimates are likely downward whereas previous revealed preference estimates are likely upward biased. },

  Abstract                 = { This article presents an empirical study of market power in the British electricity industry. Estimates of price-cost markups are derived using direct measures of marginal cost and several approaches that do not rely on cost data. Since two suppliers facing inelastic demand dominate the industry, most oligopoly models predict prices substantially above marginal costs. All estimates indicate that prices, while higher than marginal costs, are not nearly as high as most theoretical models predict. Regulatory constraints, the threat of entry, and financial contracts between the suppliers and their customers are considered as possible explanations for the observed price levels.},

Joint and two-step estimation procedures are considered. The joint procedure is a quasi-limited information maximum likelihood procedure, as one or both of the log likelihoods may be misspecified. The two-step control function approach is computationally simple and leads to straightforward tests of endogeneity. In the case of discrete endogenous explanatory variables, I argue that the control function approach can be applied with generalized residuals to obtain average partial effects. I show how the results apply to nonlinear models for fractional and nonnegative responses. },

It introduces a unified approach for implementing these tests and presents how these ideas have been realized in an R package called strucchange. Enhancing the standard significance test approach the package contains methods to fit, plot and test empirical fluctuation processes (like CUSUM, MOSUM and estimates-based processes) and to compute, plot and test sequences of F statistics with the supF , aveF and expF test. Thus, it makes powerful tools available to display information about structural changes in regression relationships and to assess their significance. Furthermore, it is described how incoming data can be monitored.},

The results showed that, in terms of their share of total industry benefits, cattle producers would prefer farm research to off-farm research; export marketing research and promotion to domestic marketing and promotion; and farm research to domestic (but not export) promotion. The article has also explored some of the methodological issues associated with the detailed modeling of a multifaceted industry. Despite the high level of disaggregation, we found EDM to be a useful methodology. \&lsqb;EconLit citations: Q13, Q16, Q18\&rsqb;. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
